**Disclaimer**⚠️:
All datasets, and reports used in the Café Harmony project are entirely fictional. They do not contain any real proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information from any company, institution, or individual. The data has been simulated purely for educational and demonstration purposes, aimed at showcasing my ability to perform advanced business analysis and dashboard reporting using Microsoft Excel in a café/restaurant retail context.

## Project Description

This project explores operational and customer data from Café Harmony, a fictional café chain, using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to analyze key business areas such as sales performance, customer feedback, employee productivity, and stock levels. Through interactive dashboards built with pivot tables, charts, and Excel formulas, this project delivers actionable insights that help optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive strategic decision-making.

## Business Introduction

Café Harmony is a growing virtual café chain offering a wide selection of beverages, pastries, and light meals across multiple city locations. With increasing customer demand and operational complexity, the management sought to understand performance trends, customer preferences, and supply chain efficiency. This project was initiated to transform raw business data into meaningful insights, supporting better decisions around marketing, staffing, inventory management, and customer experience enhancement.

## Problem Statement
Café Harmony faced challenges in making sense of its growing volume of business data across multiple locations. Management lacked visibility into key areas such as top-selling menu items, customer satisfaction, employee performance, and stock availability. Without data-driven insights, it was difficult to optimize operations, reduce stockouts, and enhance the customer experience. This project was undertaken to analyze business data and uncover actionable insights to support strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to analyze Café Harmony’s business data using Microsoft Excel in order to uncover actionable insights that enhance operational efficiency, boost sales performance, and improve customer satisfaction. By leveraging Excel dashboards and data visualizations, the project seeks to evaluate menu performance, customer behavior, employee productivity, and stock management across multiple café locations.

## Methodologies Used

**1. Data Collection & Cleaning:**
- Collected data across multiple sheets covering products, customers, employees, stock, transactions, and feedback. Cleaned and formatted the data by removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing fields for accurate analysis.

**2. Data Integration:**
- Linked datasets using common identifiers (e.g., Product ID, Employee ID, Customer ID) to create a relational structure suitable for cross-functional analysis in Excel.

**3. Calculated Fields & Formulas:**
- Used Excel formulas such as IF, XLOOKUP and conditional formatting to derive new performance fields like:
   - Performance Status (Above/Below Target)
   - Stock Level Status (Running Low, Below Ideal)
   - Sentiment Analysis from customer feedback
   - Total Sales, Profit, and Average Ratings

**4. Pivot Tables & Charts:**
- Created multiple Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze key dimensions such as:
   - Sales by product, location, age group, and gender
   - Inventory status vs. ideal stock levels
   - Staff performance against targets
   - Customer sentiment and transaction patterns

**5. Dashboard Design:**
- Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using slicers, pivot charts, KPI cards, and conditional formatting to visually communicate insights across five business areas:
   - Sales Performance
   - Customer Experience
   - Stock Management
   - Employee Performance
   - Product Insights

**6. Insight Generation & Reporting:**
Interpreted analytical results into meaningful business insights, highlighting performance gaps, trends, and opportunities. Delivered findings in a presentation-ready format with concise insights and recommendations.
