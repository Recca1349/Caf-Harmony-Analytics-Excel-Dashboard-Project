**Disclaimer**⚠️:
All datasets, and reports used in the Café Harmony project are entirely fictional. They do not contain any real proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information from any company, institution, or individual. The data has been simulated purely for educational and demonstration purposes, aimed at showcasing my ability to perform advanced business analysis and dashboard reporting using Microsoft Excel in a café/restaurant retail context.

## Project Description

This project explores operational and customer data from Café Harmony, a fictional café chain, using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to analyze key business areas such as sales performance, customer feedback, employee productivity, and stock levels. Through interactive dashboards built with pivot tables, charts, and Excel formulas, this project delivers actionable insights that help optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive strategic decision-making.

## Business Introduction

Café Harmony is a growing virtual café chain offering a wide selection of beverages, pastries, and light meals across multiple city locations. With increasing customer demand and operational complexity, the management sought to understand performance trends, customer preferences, and supply chain efficiency. This project was initiated to transform raw business data into meaningful insights, supporting better decisions around marketing, staffing, inventory management, and customer experience enhancement.
